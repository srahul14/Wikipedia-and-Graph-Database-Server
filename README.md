# Wikipedia and Graph Databases

This mini-project involves interacting with Wikipedia and performing many operations.

Some of the learning goals for this mini-project are:

* Working with external libraries (such as `jwiki` ,`gson`, and `antler`);
* Implementing reusable datatypes such as `Cache`;
* Using multi-threading to handle certain aspects of the implementation;
* Managing shared memory when multiple threads are involved;
* Implementing parsers for a given grammar and executing queries on a database.
